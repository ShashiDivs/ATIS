# About Dataset


## Context
    The ATIS dataset is a standard benchmark dataset widely used as an intent classification. 
    ATIS Stands for Airline Travel Information System. 
    Intent classification is an important component of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems in any chatbot platform.

## Content
    ATIS dataset provides large number of messages and their associated intents that can be used in training a classifier. 
    Within a chatbot, intent refers to the goal the customer has in mind when typing in a question or comment.
    While entity refers to the modifier the customer uses to describe their issue, the intent is what they really mean. 
    For example, a user says, ‘I need new shoes.’ 
    The intent behind the message is to browse the footwear on offer. 
    Understanding the intent of the customer is key to implementing a successful chatbot experience for end-user.


## Inspiration
    This dataset can be useful for intent classification problems including chatbots.
